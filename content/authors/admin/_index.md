Hello, I am a PhD student in Smart Robotics Lab at Technical University of Munich, supervised by Prof. Stefan Leutenegger. Before this, I worked closely with Prof. Laurent Kneip in Mobile Perception Lab and earned my Master degree in Computer Science from ShanghaiTech University in 2023. I obtained a Bachelor degree in Communication Engineering from Shanghai University in 2020.
